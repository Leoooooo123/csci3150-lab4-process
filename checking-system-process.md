# Checking System Process

To view a list of process in the system, we can use a handy command `top` or `ps`

For Details, please refer to Lab 2.


## top

In the terminal, type

```bash
$ top
```

The`top` program will show the current processes live, just like the Windows task manager :0\).

Consult man page for more options.

## ps

Another handy tool for checking the processes. In the terminal, we use

```
$ ps
```

![](/assets/ps.png)

This will show the current processes created by the user in this terminal. Of course, this is not quite useful. We can view all the processes in the system by:

```bash
$ ps aux
```

![](/assets/psaux.png)

The command is followed by an argument, `aux`

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| a | Shows processes from all users |
| u | Displays the owner of the process |
| x | Also shows the processes other than the terminal |


For more information, you are welcome to look at the `man` page.
